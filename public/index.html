      <h2>Steps To Program :</h2>
      <p> In this page there are four assignments. When I started coding for the first three assignments, resume, todo app and calculator, I started coding
        without <strong>"steps to program"</strong>. <br>But when I tried to code the Employee Registration assignment I found it difficult to understand the flow of control. Due 
        to that reason in I listed the Employee Registration <br>app into some <strong>main tasks</strong> and subdivided those main tasks into <strong>sub-tasks</strong> which I can implement as functions
        in my code to keep my code DRY. 
        In the Employee Registration app I have mentioned the tasks in the GIT push messages.
