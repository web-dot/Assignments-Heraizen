          <h3>Polluted Rivers</h3>
          <p>Water pollution is a serious problem in India as almost
            70 per cent of its surface water resources and a growing
            percentage of its groundwater reserves are contaminated
            by biological, toxic, organic, and inorganic pollutants.
            In many cases, these sources have been rendered unsafe
            for human consumption as well as for other activities,
            such as irrigation and industrial needs. This shows that
            degraded water quality can contribute to water scarcity
            as it limits its availability for both human use and for
            the ecosystem<br>
            In 1995, the Central Pollution Control Board
            (CPCB) identifi ed severely polluted stretches on 18
            major rivers in India. Not surprisingly, a majority of
            these stretches were found in and around large urban
            areas. The high incidence of severe contamination near
            urban areas indicates that the industrial and domestic sectors’ contribution to water pollution is much
            higher than their relative importance implied in the
            Indian economy. Agricultural activities also contribute
            in terms of overall impact on water quality. Besides a
            rapidly depleting groundwater table in diff erent parts,
            the country faces another major problem on the water
            front—groundwater contamination—a problem which
            has aff ected as many as 19 states, including Delhi. Geogenic contaminants, including salinity, iron, fluoride,
            and arsenic have aff ected groundwater in over 200
            districts spread across 19 states.</p>
