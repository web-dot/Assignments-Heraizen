          <h3>Drinking Water in schools in India</h3>
          <p>
            More than 42,000 government schools across the country don’t have drinking water facilities, while more than 15,000 schools have no toilets, Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal said on Thursday. The minister quoted the statistics from the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) database in response to a written question in the Rajya Sabha.
            “States and UTs have been repeatedly advised to ensure that all the schools, including those under the non-government sector (private, aided schools, etc.) in their jurisdiction should have provision for separate toilets for boys and girls and safe and adequate drinking water facilities for all children,” added the minister in a response to a query. The data comes at a time when sanitation, hygiene, and health are the utmost priority. Many schools across 
            the country have reopened after a yearlong shutdown due to the Covid19 pandemic, and reopening safety protocols require routine handwashing and proper sanitation. But despite the scheme and the campaign, only half of government schools and anganwadis have a tap water supply (though schools without tap water may have other water supplies, like wells). As of February 15, only 48.5% of anganwadis and 53.3% of schools had a tap water supply, reported The Hindu. Moreover, 
            less than 8% of schools in Uttar Pradesh and 11% in West Bengal have it, while it is available in only 2-6% of anganwadis in Assam, Jharkhand, U.P., Chhattisgarh, and Bengal.
            This problem extends beyond water supply and to toilet facilities as well. Data from 2018 found that students in India had access to toilets in only 73%of Indian schools. But a report from 2019 found out that in the schools that had toilets built, 22.8% of them were unusable. In addition, 11.5% of rural schools had no separate toilets for girls; and in some of the schools that did, 10.5% of them were locked and 11.7% were locked and unusable.</p>
