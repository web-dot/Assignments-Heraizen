          <h3>Ground Water Resource</h3>
          <p>As per the report, the Annual Replenishable Ground Water Resource for the entire country is 433 billion cubic metre (bcm), Net Annual Ground Water Availability is estimated as 399 billion cubic metre whereas the Annual ground water draft for irrigation, Domestic & Industrial was 231 billion cubic metre and their Stage of Ground Water Development for the Country as a whole is 58%.</p><br>
          <p>The Annual Replenishable Ground Water Resource is contributed by two major sources – rainfall and other sources that include canal seepage return flow from irrigation, seepage from water bodies and artificial recharge due to water conservation structures. The overall contribution of rainfall to country’s Annual Replenishable Ground Water Resource is 67% and the share of other sources taken together is 33%. <br>
            The contribution from other sources such as canal seepage, return flow from irrigation, seepage from water bodies etc in annual replenishable resources is more than of 33% in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Jammu &Kashmir, Jharkhand, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal and UT of Pondicherry. Southwest monsoon being the most prevalent contributor of rainfall in the country, about 73% of country’s Annual Replenishable Ground Water Recharge takes place during the Kharif period of cultivation. Keeping 34 bcm for natural discharge, the Net Ground Water Available for utilization for the entire country is 399 bcm.</p>
